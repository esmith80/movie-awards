DAY 1
- when using logic to return all page results, I found myself asking "Is this the RIGHT thing to do?" and also "Is this the right way to do it?" when using that for loop
- is it the right thing... would a user actually want to see 250 results ever? or would they prefer to type characters until the results are narrowed to something specific? probably the latter
- i could have an advanced search if the user sees too many results
- discovering some quirks of async await and wasted some time with that, could have used callbacks to make it work in a way i better understand

- excited to use an API and get it working quickly


DAY 2
- realized that async/await isn't really used to return values and need to set values i want using functions inside async/await block
- ran into an odd thing where some years have a dash '-' after the year; looking forward to using some regex to trim those
