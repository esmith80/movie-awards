   - Press the `Enter` key while your cursor is in the search input field.   
   - Click the `Search` button.
 
4. A list of movies is displayed in the search area.

### Browse Search Results

Each listing in the search results area displays a movie title, year of release, poster, and `Nominate` button. New results are automatically added to the bottom of the search area as the user scrolls downward.

>:information_source:&nbsp; If you click outside the search area, the search results will disappear. To see those results again, initiate another search with the same search text.

### Adding and removing movies from the Nominations list

>:information_source:&nbsp; To nominate a movie for an award, the movie must be listed in the search results.

To nominate a movie:
1. Click the `Nominate` button on the right side of the search listing.
2. The movie poster is displayed in the `Nominations` area and that search listing will show a nomination icon 🏆 to indicate it has been nominated.

To remove a movie from the nominations list:
1. Click the purple **X** icon in the corner of the nominated movie's poster.

>:information_source:&nbsp; You may nominate a maximum of five (5) movies. The application automatically saves the nominations and preserves them if you navigate away from the page or close your browser. The list of nominations is associated with your device, and so accessing the site on a different device provides a seperate list of nominations.
