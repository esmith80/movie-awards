This project is based on a ficticious movie awards show. This site allows a user to nominate 5 movies for and award. 

The initial state of this project is represented with a live app here: https://esmith80.github.io/shopify-front/ so a comparison can be drawn between the initial state and the final version of this project.

Functionality:
- a user can search for movies
- a user can view a list of movies to nominate
- a user may nominate movies for a Shoppie award
- a user can nominate movies, close browser or shut down computer and nominations are saved
- starts-with search (search term has wildcard at end of by default)
- type-ahead search results (clickable to search for title of movie)

Under construction: 
- Mobile layout. There are various things that don't look good on mobile right now (e.g. There are current issuess where the nominations area becomes cluttered at small screen sizes if 5 movies have been added to the nominations list)
