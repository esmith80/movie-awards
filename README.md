This project is based on a ficticious movie awards show. This site allows a user to nominate up to 5 movies for an award. 

The app is live here: https://esmith80.github.io/movie-awards/

Functionality:
- uses the omdb API (http://www.omdbapi.com/) to get movie information
- a user can search for movies by title
- a user can view a list of movies to nominate
- infinite scroll lets a user keep scrolling based on their initial search term
- a user may nominate movies for an award
- a user can close the browser or shut down their computer and nominations are saved (local storage)
- starts-with search (search term has wildcard at end of by default)
- clickable type-ahead search results (click a result to trigger search for title of movie)

Under construction:
- More info in nominations area (picture in search, short synopsis in nominations area)

Read the [user guide](user_guide.md) for information on how to use the app.
