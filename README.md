#The Shoppies are a ficticious awards show. This site allows a user to nominate 5 movies for a Shoppie.

#Core functionality:
- a user can search for movies
- a user can view a list of movies to nominate
- a user may nominate movies for a Shoppie award

#Additional features:
- I noticed that search results were not returned for a starts-with word search and added this ability.
- I added the logic so that a userâ€™s nominations would persist if they leave the web page (or even close their browser) and visit the page again later.
- I began to implement different layouts based on the size of the screen (using CSS breakpoints) but that functionality was not completed.

#Known issues (to be fixed in a future iteration):
- The nominations area becomes cluttered at small screen sizes if 5 movies have been added to the nominations list
